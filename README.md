Stopwatch Web Application : Project for Prodigy InfoTech Internship
Task#2:
To build a stopwatch web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application.
By implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times, users can accurately measure and record time intervals.
With these technologies and functionalities, you can create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.

Knowledge gained:
路 DOM Manipulation: Improved at selecting and changing HTML elements using 'document.querySelector' and 'innerHTML'.
路 Event Handling: Learned how to use event listeners to handle button clicks and record lap times.
路 Timer Logic: Better understood how to use setInterval and clearInterval for accurate time tracking.
路 Creating Dynamic Elements: Learned to create and add new elements to the page, showing lap times in real-time.
